# ENTER DECSRIPTION OF TASK PERFORMED NOT LESS THAN 500 WORDS:
  In completing my internship task of creating a Push Button Counter with an LCD Display, I made use of several reference resources to help me understand the hardware and programming involved. The primary platforms I used were Tinkercad, YouTube, Google, and ChatGPT, each providing unique and complementary features that greatly supported my project development.

Tinkercad
Using Autodesk's Tinkercad to design and simulate my push button counter circuit was very useful in building the physical one. This free, online, drag-and-drop beginner's tool features many electronic components, such as push buttons, resistors, 16x2 LCDs, and Arduino Uno microcontrollers. This feature of simulating circuits let me connect and test my components before building it in the physical world.
In this project, I designed a circuit where the press of a push button increments a counter that is displayed on the LCD. With Tinkercad support for Arduino programming, I uploaded the C/C++ code to simulate the button press behavior and verify that my counter incremented correctly. The simulation also helped in detecting logic and wiring issues earlier, saving me time and resources by preventing errors during the physical assembly phase. The button press detection is further improved through testing different debounce techniques in Tinkercad.

YouTube
YouTube acted as a dynamic visual guide toward understanding the building and programming of push button counters with LCDs. I watched numerous tutorials on wiring an Arduino to connect a push button and LCD for displaying a counter. These video tutorials provided the step-by-step instructions and provided insight into good practices for attaching components and code writing.
Specific concepts learned include:

Connect a push button to the digital pins on an Arduino to detect input
An I2C interface is used to make LCD connections much easier or via standard pin-out
Debounce logic: prevent multiple counts of a button being pressed
Visual demonstrations at YouTube combined with annotations and troubleshooting advice from seasoned creators helped amplify practical experience and helped overcome problems such as display malfunction and button press miscount.
Google
Google was the go-to source for locating documentation, tutorials, and community-developed solutions. Searches for "push button counter with Arduino LCD code" and "debounce techniques for Arduino buttons" brought up forums like Stack Overflow and Arduino Project Hub. I also consulted the datasheets of the push button and LCD to make sure voltage levels and pin configurations were proper.
Google Also, through the search on Google, I did a variety of code examples and wiring diagrams which expanded my awareness of different multiple implementation approaches, so I would be able to compare and select the solution needed by my project, adjust it to it.

ChatGPT
During the coding procedure, ChatGPT greatly supported providing coding help for complex technical notions. I tried ChatGPT in:

Giving sample Arduino code for a counter with an LCD display for the push button.
Describe using functions such as digitalRead(), lcd.print() and debounce logic
Debug my code by identifying where I did it wrong, as well as providing optimal ways of writing
When problems encountered the debouncing of buttons as well as counters' accuracy, ChatGPT described common methods for debouncing, and example code using millis() to count over time, avoiding blocking in the main program loop. Its capacity to develop personalized code snippet, as well as comments detailed, greatly accelerated the coding work for me.
